## Project Description

lorem ipsum...

## For Developers
This section covers neccessary information for further development of the project.

### Setup development environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Create .env file in root directory and set variables
```
DB_PORT= (Port number for the database container) // Only development
API_PORT= (Port number for the API container) // Only development
FRONTEND_PORT= (Port number for frontend container)
FRONTEND_ORIGIN= (Origin for frontend when calling API)
POSTGRES_HOST= (Name of the postgres container)
POSTGRES_USER= (Username for default user in postgres database)
POSTGRES_PASSWORD= (Password for default user in postgres database)
POSTGRES_DB= (Name of the database)
PGADMIN_EMAIL= (Email for Postgres Admin Login)
PGADMIN_PASSWORD= (Password for Postgres Admin Login)
```
3. Run `docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build -d` when in root directory
4. Verify success with `docker ps`
5. Access frontend at [http://www.localhost:[FRONTEND_PORT]](http://www.localhost:3000)

### Setup development tools
Some tools are made available in the development environment. See the sections below on how to use them.

#### Hot Module Reload

1. Run `docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build -d` to rebuild and start all containers.
2. Run `docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up frontend --build --watch` to allow hot module reload for the frontend.

#### pgadmin

1. Run `docker compose --profile tools up` to containerize tools such as pgadmin used for database debugging.
2. Access pgadmin at [localhost:[PGADMIN_PORT]](localhost:8080).
3. Login using .env variable for `PGADMIN_EMAIL` and `PGADMIN_PASSWORD`.
4. Connect to the database by **Adding a new Server**.
5. Set the name to your choosing.
6. Navigate to the **Connection** tab.
7. Enter the host name address to match the service name, by default `db`.
8. Enter the username, should match that of .env variable: `POSTGRES_USER`.
9. Enter the password, should match that of .env variable: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
10. Press save.
11. You can now access the database using pgadmin.

> [!CAUTION] 
> You need to use `docker compose --profile tools down` to properly stop the pgadmin container.

### üöÄ NPM Scripts for Docker

Skip the long `docker compose` commands with these handy npm scripts.  
Just make sure you have your `.env` file in place.

#### üîß Available Commands

- **`npm run docker:all`** ‚Äì Spins up all services (frontend, backend, db) with fresh builds.
- **`npm run docker:frontend`** ‚Äì Starts only the frontend (no backend/db).
- **`npm run docker:backend`** ‚Äì Starts only the backend (no db).

#### üì¶ Under the Hood

```bash
# docker:all
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build -d

# docker:frontend
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --no-deps -d frontend

# docker:backend
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --no-deps -d backend
```

### Workflow

To allow for efficient development with focus on refactorization, each issue should be tackled with intent of creating modular solutions. For example:

Issue: Display users on dedicated page on the frontend
Solution: Create re-usable script for fetching, then use script to fetch data and display on page.
Why: Changes to the API endpoint (for example due to introducing authorization), does not require multiple scripts to be altered. Instead only the script dedicatetd for fetching requires updating.


### TDD and running tests
Currently the backend is being implemented using TDD. The tests have been separated into two categories, unit and integration. The integration tests require containers to be live, while unit tests can be executed using mocking behaviour. Unit tests at the current state mostly verifies the error handling, implemented with the purpose of limiting the number of errornous calls to the database.

The tests can be automatically executed by running the [script](/tests/run-api-test.sh). Selecting on of the availables modes:

`./run-api-test.sh [mode]`
1. **full**: Executes both integration and unit tests.
2. **integration**
3. **unit**
4. **lint**: Lints the project using eslint.

>[!NOTE]
> The script returns 0 if all tests succeed and 1 if not. These results may be used in CICD pipeline to prevent code with failed tests from being pushed to production.

>[!NOTE]
> The script returns 0 if all lint succeed and 1 if not. These results may be used in CICD pipeline to prevent code that did not pass the lint to be pushed to production.

### Server setup with Cloudflare tunnel

# Hosting Docker Web App with Cloudflare Tunnel on Raspberry Pi

This guide shows how to self-host a Dockerized web app on a Raspberry Pi using **Cloudflare Tunnel** ‚Äî without needing port forwarding, nginx, or TLS setup.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with Docker & Docker Compose installed
- A domain name on Cloudflare (e.g. `qkeliq.eu`)
- A Cloudflare account

---

## üîß Step 1: Install `cloudflared`

```bash
# Add Cloudflare's apt repo
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-main.gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/cloudflare-main.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/cloudflare-main.gpg] https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflared bullseye main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudflared.list > /dev/null

# Install
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cloudflared
```

## üîê Step 2: Authenticate with Cloudflare

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```
this will open your browser to log in to Cloudflare and authorize the machine.

## üöá Step 3: Create Tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create my-tunnel
```
Note the generated tunnel ID and credentials JSON file path.

## üåê Step 4: Configure Tunnel

Create the config file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/cloudflared/config.ym
```
Paste the following (or just fill in hostname and such if needed..):
```bash
tunnel: my-tunnel
credentials-file: /home/USERNAME/.cloudflared/TUNNEL_ID.json

ingress:
  - hostname: qkeliq.eu
    service: http://localhost:3000
  - service: http_status:404

```
Replace USERNAME with the computers user and TTUNEL_ID.json wih the actual JSON filename.


## üåç Step 5: Route Domain to Tunnel

Delete any existing A or CNAME record for qkeliq.eu in the Cloudflare DNS dashboard, then run:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns my-tunnel qkeliq.eu
```
This will automatically create a proper CNAME that routes to your tunnel.
Make sure your application is listtening on the correct port, eg. port 3000.


## üõ†Ô∏è Step 6: Start Tunnel as a Service

Run:
```bash
sudo cloudflared service install
sudo systemctl start cloudflared
sudo systemctl enable cloudflared
```
This sets up cloudflared as a systemd service and runs it in the background ‚Äî even after reboot.

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

| Problem               | Fix                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `521 Web Server Down` | Make sure your frontend is running and listening on the right port |
| Tunnel doesn't start  | Check logs: `journalctl -u cloudflared -e`                         |
| Local service down    | Use `docker ps` to verify containers are running                   |
| Test locally          | Run `curl -I http://localhost:3000`                                |


### SSH to server
On the device you‚Äôll connect from, install cloudflared.
On macOS:
```bash
brew install cloudflared
```

On Linux:
```bash
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
```

To connect to the server use this one-liner:
```bash
ssh -o ProxyCommand="cloudflared access ssh --hostname ssh.qkeliq.eu" waup@ssh.qkeliq.eu
```

If you rather use a shorter version, then you can add this to your ssh config file (else skip this last part):
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/confi
```
Add:
```bash
Host qkeliq
  HostName ssh.qkeliq.eu
  User waup
  ProxyCommand cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h
```

Lastly connect with:
```bash
ssh pi
```

### Issues

1. Open the issue on github.com
2. Assign the issue to yourself.
3. Create a branch for the issue
4. On development machine, run `git fetch origin`
5. On development machine, run `git checkout <issue-branch-name>`



## Features

The system includes a variety of features designed to streamline operations. Each feature corresponds to a department or major workflow within the company, and may consist of multiple sub-features, referred to as functionalities. These functionalities are tailored to support specific tasks within the broader feature. Each listed feature is detailed in their respective sections below. Features currently being implemented or already implemented include:

- [ ] Authentication and Authorization (AA)
- [ ] Inventory Management System (IMS)

### Authenication and Authorization

The Authentication and Authorization features enables the use of role-based authentication and claim-based authentication to restrict access to certain features and resources. The following features entail details on how authorization has been utilized specificallty in the respective feature. The roles have been developed using *the principle of least prielege*. The table below lists the currently available roles, the respective feature they relate to, and a description of the permission given to each role.

|Role|Feature|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Admin|Global|Posseses all permissions within the system, including administrative and configuration capabilites.|
|Role Manager|AA|Posseses permissions to manage roles, including adding and removing roles, as well as managing permissions given to roles.|
|User Manager|AA|Posseses permissions to manage users and their roles, including adding, removing, and updating users, whilst also managing users' roles.|
|Inventory Manager|IMS|Posseses all permissions given within the inventory management system. Including adding, editing, deleting inventory items, and modyfying the list of items.|
|Inventory Worker|IMS|Posseses the minimal required permissions to perform daily inventory tasks, such as updating stock levels and recording transactions.|
|Inventory Viewer|IMS| Posseses read-only permissions, allowing them to view inventory data without making any changes.|

#### AA Functionalities

|Name|Purpose|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Login|Allows for the authentication of users.|The user is required to log in when accessing the internal pages.|
|Authorized routing|Restricts access to certain functionalities by restricting page access to certain roles and claims.|The user is required to posses the correct permissions to access restricted pages.|
|Tokens|Provides secure token-based authentication and authorization.|JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used to securely transmit information between parties and verify user identities and permissions.|
|Role Dashboard|Allows the user to modify the roles within the system.|The user may add, update, and remove roles. The user may also modify a roles' permissions by modifying its claims.|
|User Dashboard|Allows the user to access the user within the system.|The user may add, update, and remove users within the system. The user may also modify a user's permissions either by modifying their roles or claims.|

#### AA Database Diagram

The database diagram relating to authentication and authorization within the application is shown below.
![Authentication and Authorization database diagram](documentation/aa-diagram.png)

### Inventory management system

The inventory management system helps workers to efficiently track and update inventory. It allows the users to update the item quantity in stock, rented out, and marked faulty for each item available in the system. Additionally, the system supports role-based access control, enabling certain users to edit the inventory items themselves based on their assigned role. The system uses general-purpose objects to accommodate a wide range of items that may be stored in the inventory, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

#### Inventory Database Diagram

![Inventory database diagram](documentation/db-diagram-inventory.png)
|Table|Purpose|Real-world example|
|---|---|---|
|Rentable|Items that are available for rental.|A 5x5 tent.|
|Part|Components for specific rentables.|Window roof, standard roof, window wall, standard wall.|
|Part Variant|Variants for parts, such as white wall/window wall.|
|Extension|Extra 5 meters.|
|Extension From Parts|Use rentable part for extensions.|
|Item|Components used in multiple a rentables.|Nails, bolts.|
